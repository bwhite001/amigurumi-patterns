If you want to know how to install Chrome extensions manually. Then you can use the Developer mode. However, the developer mode is only recommended to create and debug your Chrome extension. Therefore, it is not allowed to use for daily use in your Chrome web browser.

Download the CRX file to your computer for the Chrome extension you want to install.
Open your Google Chrome web browser.
Go to chrome://extensions/ and check the box for Developer mode in the top right.

Totally the CRX stands for Chromium Extension. The file that can install this extra item in your web browser without the use of a setup or wizard.

The CRX (=Chromium Extension) file is a ZIP file format with a signed text file from the Chrome web store. If you want to see the content in the CRX file, just edit the file extension type from .crx to .zip. Next, open it with your zip manager application (such as 7zip, Rar Extractor). And the unzipped file can then be opened in the “Load unpacked” button in your Chromium web browser.

Chromium web browsers are Google Chrome, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, Yandex, Naver Whale, and Microsoft Edge.
